# Publish SPA for GitHub Pages - MSBuild Task & Scripts (designed for Blazor WebAssembly) [![NuGet Package](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/PublishSPAforGitHubPages.Build.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PublishSPAforGitHubPages.Build/)

## Summary

This is a NuGet package that provides post published processing to deploy the .NET Core SPA project (such as Blazor WebAssembly) as a GitHub pages site.

- **Rewriting base URL** in `index.html`
- Generating `.nojekyll`,  `.gitattributes`, and **`404.html`**.
- Make it to be fetching assembly files (**"~.dll.br"**) that are **pre-compressed by the Brotli** algorithm. (if the site is a Blazor WebAssembly site.)
- **PWA support** (rewriting file hash in the service worker assets manifest file (ex.`service-worker-assets.js`) to latest valid file hash)

## Usage

At first, "git clone" or "git push" the .NET Core SPA (such as Blazor WebAssembly) project at your local disk from/to GitHub repository.

Because, this package **detect GitHub repository URL automatically** from the information inside a `.git` folder **to determine a URL of `<base/>` element**.

_**Note:**_ You can specify the base URL by yourself explicitly. If you want to do it, please see the later section in this document.

### for dotnet CLI users

#### 1. Install this package

Install this package to the project.

```shell
> dotnet add package PublishSPAforGitHubPages.Build
```

#### 2. Publish it with `GHPages=true`

After installing this package, publish the project with **setting `GHPages` MSBuild property to `true`.**

To set the `GHPages` MSBuild property to `true`, you can specify it in `dotnet publish` command line arguments, like this.

```shell
> dotnet publish -c:Release -p:GHPages=true
```

Then, you may get published files that are patched for deploying to a GitHub pages site.

_**Note:**_ To set the `GHPages` MSBuild property to `true`, you can do that by the same with Visual Studio user's way too, such as editing the project file (.csproj) or publish profile file (.pubxml). For lean more about that way, please see also "for Visual Studio users" section.

### for Visual Studio users

#### 1. Install this package

Install this package to the project.

To do this, use the "Package Manager" GUI, or enter the below command in the "Package Manager Console" window of Visual Studio.

```powershell
PM> Install-Package PublishSPAforGitHubPages.Build
```

You can also to do it by direct editing the `.csproj` file to add `<PackageReference/>` node.

```xml
<!-- This is .csproj file -->
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  ...
  <ItemGroup>
    ...
    <!-- ðŸ‘‡ Add this node inside any "ItemGroup" node. -->
    <PackageReference Include="PublishSPAforGitHubPages.Build" Version="1.3.0" />
    ...
```

#### 2. Publish it with `GHPages=true`

After installing this package, publish the project with **setting `GHPages` MSBuild property to `true`.**

To set the `GHPages` MSBuild property to `true`, you can edit the `.csproj` file and append at MSBuild property node, like this.

```xml
<!-- This is .csproj file -->
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    ...
    <!-- ðŸ‘‡ Add this node inside any "PropertyGroup" node. -->
    <GHPages>true</GHPages>
    ...
```

Another way, create publish profile file (.pubxml) and edit it to append `GHPages` MSBuild property in the profile file.

```xml
<!-- This is Properties/PublishProfiles/*.pubxml file -->
<Project ToolsVersion="4.0" xmlns="...">
  ...
  <!-- ðŸ‘‡ Add this node at the end of 
          the inner of the "Project" node. -->
  <PropertyGroup>
    <GHPages>true</GHPages>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

## What does this package do when publishing the project

This package does the following steps after publishing of the .NET Core SPA project when the `GHPages` MSBuild property is `true`.

- Rewriting the URL in `<base href="..."/>` element in the `index.html` to fit the GitHub page URL.
- Copy the `index.html` to the `404.html`.
- Generate `.nojekyll` file and `.gitattributes` file.
- **[Pre-compression support for Blazor WebAssembly]** Enable fetching pre-compressed assembly files. (for a Blazor WebAssembly site)
- **[PWA Support]** Rewrite the hash code of the `index.html` in the service worker assets manifest file (ex.`service-worker-assets.js`) if it exists.
- **[PWA Support for Blazor WebAssembly]** Rewrite all of the hash codes of files that are "Brotli" compressed in the service worker assets manifest file (ex.`service-worker-assets.js`) if the manifest file exists and fetching pre-compressed assembly files is enabled.

### Working folder

These steps are applied to **the `wwwroot` folder under the publish folder**.

If you want to change the folder that you want to apply those steps, you can modify it by setting the folder path to `GHPagesRoot` MSBuild property explicitly.

### Determining the base URL

The base URL is determined automatically from the GitHub repository URL that comes from  finding local `.git` folder and retrieve information from it.
(**The remote name must be "origin".**)

This feature will work well to all site types of GitHub pages, such as "Project site", "User site", and "Organization site".

If you want to specify the base URL by yourself, you can do it by setting the base URL  to `GHPagesBase` MSBuild property explicitly.

### Enable fetching pre-compressed assembly files. (for a Blazor WebAssembly site)

If the `index.html` contains the reference of the Blazor WebAssembly loader script file, this package injects the custom loader script into the `index.html` to enable fetching pre-compressed assembly files (.dll.br).

If you disable this behavior, set `GHPagesInjectBrotliLoader` MSBuild property to `false`.

### Works with "GitHub Actions" to deploy it to GitHub page site

You can deploy your .NET Core SPA project (ex.Blazor WebAssembly project) to a GitHub page site by using this package and "GitHub Actions".

To do it, after configuring the project by following the instructions in this document, add a GitHub Actions workflow file (.yml) to the git repository, like this example.

```yaml
# This is ".github/workflows/gh-pages.yml" file.
# This is an EXAMPLE of "GitHub Actions Workflow file".

name: github pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout the code
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Install .NET Core SDK
      - name: Setup .NET Core
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
        with:
          dotnet-version: 6.0.101

      # Publish the site
      - name: Publish
        run: dotnet publish {YourSolution}.sln -c:Release -o:public -p:GHPages=true

      # Deploy the site
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: public/wwwroot
          force_orphan: true
```

In this example workflow file, the project is published to the GitHub page site each master branch pushed.
